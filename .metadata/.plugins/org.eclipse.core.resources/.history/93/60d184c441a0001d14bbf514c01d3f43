/*

b.   The second class will be Player.java, which must include the following (which we will discuss together in class):
i.   Instance fields: name, space, money, doubles, whichPiece, inJail (should be boolean), and anything else we discuss and agree is relevant to the player. 
ii.  Constructor:  To make all our programs uniform, type your constructor so it responds to the following initialization (please inform me if you are going to add any extra parameters):

new Player (String name)

The rest of the instance fields (like space, money, etc.) should receive initial/default values inside the constructor’s code.
iii. Accessor and Mutator Methods: getName and possibly setName; 
get & setSpace as well as movePiece (moving the piece is different than setting the space); 
addDoubles, getDoubles, and resetDoubles (to zero); isInJail (returns inJail); 
getPiece, get & setMoney (allows you to send a positive OR negative value to add OR remove money); 
toString (which should return a nice neat String to print a player’s status in the game); 
and anything else relevant that we discuss.
