Section 10 - 6
  methods are determined by the type of the actual object, not the type of the object reference
  
  10.1 - Abstract classes
    mix between an interface and a superclass
    contains written code like the superclass but cannot be instantiated
    
    Ex:
    
        public abstract class Shape
        {
            
        }
        
Section 10 - 7

    levels of access
        *public, private, protected, package access
        
        protected: used w/ inheritance - allows a subclass to use an instance field or method from the superclass without referring to it as super or w/ privacy error
        package access this is not a desirable result
